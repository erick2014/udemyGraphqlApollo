root query: 
is something that allows me to jump into our graph of data, entry point into our data, jump and land on a very specific node in the graph of all our data

fragments( more frecuently used in client side): 
Are a way to reuse properties in queries, this is to avoid repeating the same 
properties in queries.

query{
    apple:company(id:"1"){
        ...companyDetails
    }
    google:company(id:"1"){
        ...companyDetails
    }
}

fragment companyDetails on Company{
    id
    name
    description
}

GraphQL Schema consists on:
query -> root query -> UserType
query -> root query -> companyType

mutation -> mutations-> addUser
mutation -> mutations-> deleteUser
